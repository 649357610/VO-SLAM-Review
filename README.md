# Visual-Odometry-Review
SLAM is mainly divided into two parts: the front end and the back end. The front end is the visual odometer (VO), which roughly estimates the motion of the camera based on the information of adjacent images and provides a good initial value for the back end.The implementation methods of VO can be divided into two categories according to whether features are extracted or not: feature point-based methods, and direct methods without feature points. VO based on feature points is stable and insensitive to illumination and dynamic objects
